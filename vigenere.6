.Sh NAME
.Nm vigenere ,
.Nm kasiski
.Nd polyalphabetic cipher encryption and attack utilities
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm vigenere
.Op Fl de
.Ar key
.Nm kasiski
.Op Fl ep
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm vigenere
utility implements encryption and decryption using the Vigenere
polyalphabetic shift cipher on a given alphabetic key.
The
.Nm kasiski
utility implements a method of cryptanalysis of such cipher based on
Kasiski examination and frequence analysis.
.Pp
.Nm vigenere
uses the
.Ar key
given as argument to encrypt or decrypt the text read from standard input.
The result is written into standard output.
Both the
.Ar key
argument and the standard input must contain plain alphabetic characters
(ie, uppercase or lowercase latin letters) encoded in ASCII;
any other character is ignored and is output as it is, without being encrypted or decrypted.
.Pp
The options for
.Nm vigenere
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Perform decryption
.It Fl e
Perform encryption
(this is the default if no option is given).
.El
.Pp
.Nm kasiski
reads a ciphertext from standard input and tries to guess the key used to encrypt it with
.Nm vigenere .
The guessed key is written into standard output.
The read ciphertext must have been generated by
.Nm vigenere
on either an English plaintext message or a Portuguese plaintext message
(only the frequency of letters in those languages are known).
.Pp
The options for
.Nm kasiski
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Use letter frequency in the English language for the frequency analysis.
(this is the default if no option is given).
.It Fl p
Use letter frequency in the Portuguese language for the frequency analysis.

.Sh EXAMPLES
Consider the following message text in the file
.Pa "sample.txt" :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
I'd just like to interject for a moment.  What you're referring to as
Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it,
GNU plus Linux.  Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but
rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made
useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components
comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day,
without realizing it.  Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of
GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its
users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by
the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a
part of the system they use.  Linux is the kernel: the program in the
system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that
you run.  The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but
useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete
operating system.  Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU
operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or
GNU/Linux.  All the so-called "Linux" distributions are really
distributions of GNU/Linux.

The following example encrypts the message:
using the string
.Qq "stallman"
as key.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ <sample.txt vigenere -e stallman

.Pp
The following example encrypts and then decrypts the same message
using the same key.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ <sample.txt vigenere -e stallman | vigenere -d stallman
I'd just like to interject for a moment.  [...]

.Pp
The following example encrypts the same message using the same key
and then tries to guess the key used to encrypt it.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ <sample.txt vigenere -e stallman | kasiski -e

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm vigenere
and
.Nm kasiski
utilities are the product of a project for 2022 2nd semester's course of
Cyber Security of the Computer Science department of the University of
Brasilia, Brasil.
.Sh BUGS
.Nm kasiski
is not perfect.
It may not guess the key for relly short messages,
messages with more coincidental than accidental trigram repetitions,
messages with no trigram repetition at all,
or messages with a letter frequency very different from the ones common in the English or Portuguese languages.
.Pp
Short keys may be correctly guessed, but repeated a few number of times
(which are also valid. In the Vigenere cipher, a key is equivalent to its repetition).
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ <sample.txt vigenere -e gnu | kasiski -e
gnugnugnugnu
.Ed
.Pp
Mid-size to long keys whose length is a prime number are probably guessed wrong:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ <sample.txt vigenere -e installgentoo | kasiski -e
inwtallgentooihstaalhpntooinstallkentdoinstallgenguo
.Ed
.Pp
Fiddling with the THRESHOLD value in the code can sometimes make
.Nm kasiski
guess the right key.
.Pp
.Nm kasiski
also uses lots of memory.
Mostly because of its trigram hashtable with no collision.
